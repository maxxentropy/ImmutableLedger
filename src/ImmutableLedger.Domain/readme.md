# ImmutableLedger.Domain

## Overview

The Domain layer is the core of the Immutable Ledger system, representing the heart of the business logic. In Clean Architecture, this layer contains enterprise-wide logic and types, and it's independent of any external concerns or application-specific logic.

## Purpose

The Domain layer serves several critical purposes:

1. Defines the core business logic and rules of the Immutable Ledger system.
2. Encapsulates the essential concepts of the business domain as entities and value objects.
3. Defines interfaces for data access and domain services.
4. Remains independent of any external frameworks or technologies.

## Key Components

### Entities

- **LedgerEntry**: Represents an immutable entry in the ledger, encapsulating all information for a single financial transaction.

### Interfaces

- **ILedgerRepository**: Defines the contract for ledger data access operations, abstracting the data persistence mechanism.

### Value Objects

- (To be added as needed to represent domain concepts that are defined by their attributes rather than an identity)

## Design Principles

1. **Immutability**: Domain objects, particularly LedgerEntry, are designed to be immutable to ensure data integrity and thread safety.
2. **Rich Domain Model**: Encapsulate business logic within domain entities and value objects where appropriate.
3. **Dependency Inversion**: Define abstractions (interfaces) that will be implemented by outer layers.
4. **Ubiquitous Language**: Use terminology consistent with the business domain throughout the layer.
5. **Separation of Concerns**: Keep the domain logic isolated from application and infrastructure concerns.

## Usage

The Domain layer should be used as the foundation for building the application:

- Reference this layer in other layers of the application.
- Implement the interfaces defined here in the Infrastructure layer.
- Use the entities and value objects to model the core business concepts throughout the application.

## Extending the Domain Layer

When extending this layer:

1. Add new entities or value objects to represent new domain concepts.
2. Extend existing entities with new behavior as the business rules evolve.
3. Define new interfaces for domain services or repositories as needed.
4. Ensure any additions adhere to the principle of keeping the domain independent of external concerns.

## Testing

The Domain layer is ideal for unit testing:

- Focus on testing business rules encapsulated in entities and value objects.
- Use TDD (Test-Driven Development) when adding new domain logic.
- Ensure high test coverage for this layer as it forms the core of the application.

## Dependencies

The Domain layer should have no dependencies on external libraries or frameworks, except for the base .NET framework. It should not reference any other layers of the application.

## Best Practices

1. Keep the Domain layer focused on business logic, avoiding any infrastructure or application-specific concerns.
2. Use meaningful and expressive names for classes, methods, and properties that reflect the ubiquitous language of the domain.
3. Document complex business rules or calculations within the code.
4. Consider using domain events to represent significant occurrences within the domain.
5. Regularly review and refactor the domain model with domain experts to ensure it accurately represents the business requirements.
